# Drink-Quality-Predictor
This repository contains final project of Statistical Learning (or Regression Analysis) course. I analyze the quality of different drinks by using classical methods of machine learning like, decision tree, regression and other methods. I did this analysis by using scikit-learn and pandas. Hope it will be useful for you :)
